## January 5th Homework

This is the password generator I have made based on the code given.

Please note that the password variable no longer calls a different function.  
I decided to put the function in the existing function.

This will correctly give a password betweeen 8-128 characters, and based on the criteria given by the user.
This will also give errors in the chance that the user enters any asnwer outside the boundaries of the criteria.
